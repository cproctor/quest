# Quest

Quest provides a simpler interface to python's Arcade library. 

## Creating sprites and maps
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- [Tileset resources](https://opengameart.org/content/best-orthogonal-rectangular-tilesets-for-tilemaps)
- [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com) for drawing sprites

## TODO 

- Write documentation
- Wrap sprites in simpler class (including animated textures, sounds, callbacks)
- Implement a dialogue system

## Pedagogy
- Have students trace inheritance chain of classes, list method instances.
- Have students trace call execution through class methods
- Have students implement subclasses using method hooks
